During system enumeration, we discovered TightVNC is running on ports 5801 and 5901. This calls for SSH port forwarding!

I ran the below command on my attack box:

`ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 charix@poison.htb`

This essentially says to listen on port 5901 on my local machine, and send all requests from that port, to port 5901 of the remote machine using SSH. This article helped me understand the process a bit better:

With our tunnel in place, we can use a VNC viewer to connect to the internal VNC server through our tunnel. There are many options to choose from, although Kali comes installed with `vncviewer`. We try to connect...

And are blocked with a password! The password for Charix doesn't work, nor are there any predefined default credentials for the TightVNC server. Thinking back to enumeration, we came across `secret.zip`. This unzips to an odd "Non-ISO extended-ASCII text" file. Considering the file name is `secret`, and the usage for `tightvnc` mentions we can include a password file, it makes sense to pass the `secret` as an argument to `vncviewer`. We cross our fingers...

Voila! We did it :)
